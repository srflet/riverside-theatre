                The theatre hosts both in-house productions and external shows on two stages:

                <ul>
                    <li>The main stage hosts shows requiring larger sets or casts (seating 1000). A smaller studio theatre (seating 70) hosts small shows on the second floor. There are bars that serve beverages, and a recently installed elevator for seniors or disabled audience members.</li>

                    <li>External shows are typically Broadway shows that the theater book by paying a certain fee. Internally produced shows are developed by the <em>Riverside Theatreâ€™s</em> creative staff and cost less than external shows.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Last year, 53% of group tickets were purchased by corporate groups, 14% by social clubs, 13% hospital staff, 8% by theater clubs, and 5% by charity groups.</li>

                    <li>Marketing research suggests several demographic groups have registered strong interests. These groups are 1) retirement community and senior clubs, and 2) schools, from kindergarten to high school.</li>
