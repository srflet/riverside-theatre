						<h3>Project Title</h3>
						<p>
							Understanding decision making
         			 	</p>

						<h3>Purpose of the Study</h3>
						<p>
							This research is being conducted by Dr.Thomas Taiyi Yan and Dr. Vijaya Ventakaramani, at the University of Maryland, College Park. We are inviting you to participate in this study because you are at least 18 years old and an undergraduate enrolled in a business class at the University of Maryland. The purpose of this research project is to better understand decision making.
          				</p>

						<h3>Procedures</h3>
						<p>
							The procedures will take less than 30 minutes, in which you will be asked to play as a private detective solving a case, along with two other private detectives who are also played by students in the behavioral lab. You will read about a “murder mystery”, then discuss with the other two players, and indicate your final verdict. Upon completion, you will receive 2% of your course credit.
          				</p>

						<h3>Potential Risks and Discomforts</h3>
						<p>
							There are no known risks and discomfort associated with participating in this research study.
          				</p>

						<h3>Potential Benefits</h3>
						<p>
							There are no direct benefits to you by participating in this research. Some potential benefits include learning more about research, and about the various topics in this particular session. We hope that, in the future, other people might benefit from this study through improved understanding of workplace interactions.
          				</p>

						<h3>Confidentiality</h3>
						<p>
							Any potential loss of confidentiality will be minimized by being stored in password protected computers and all records being made anonymous. Only researchers will have access to the data. The confidentiality of the subjects participating in the experiments will be maintained.  To maintain subject confidentiality, the electronic datasets generated during the studies will be stored in a password-protected network directory accessible only to investigators.
          				</p>

						<p>
							Data will be stored for a period of five years after all journal articles based on the data have been published, then the data will be destroyed by deletion. Subjects’ names will not be associated with the data collected at any time, so it will be impossible to identify the responses of individual subjects. The data collected will be associated only with randomly assigned subject ID numbers that cannot be used to identify individual subjects. The data will be analyzed by experimental condition rather than by individual subject.
						  </p>

						<p>
							If we write a report or article about this research project, your identity will be protected to the maximum extent possible. Your information may be shared with representatives of the University of Maryland, College Park or governmental authorities if you or someone else is in danger or if we are required to do so by law.
						  </p>

						<h3>Compensation</h3>
						<p>
							Upon completion, you will receive course credit completion. In addition, if you perform well in the game, you may earn up to $20 in Amazon Gift Card.
          				</p>
